# Procesing Data for ML Project: Image Classification Model

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a robust and scalable infrastructure that empowers  data scientists to create image classification models with ease. In this project AWS's suite of services are utilized to efficiently train, deploy, and manage image classification models at scale.
The data was sourced from https://vizwiz.org/ this companyâ€™s goal in computer vision research is to build machines that can replicate the human vision system; to recognize and describe objects/scenes.
With the help of visually impaired volunteers, a total of 32,842 pictures were taken of various household items that fall into 200 categories.
Our model will be trained on 20,523 images, validated on 5% of the training set and tested on 8,900 unseen images.
