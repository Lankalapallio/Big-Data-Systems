# Procesing Data for ML Project: Image Classification Model

## Project Description
This project aims to explore the impact of fusion voting on third-party viability in American politics. The two-party system has long dominated American politics, but there's growing interest in fostering the viability of third parties. Fusion voting, a practice where a third party cross-nominates a candidate from one of the major parties, offers a potential avenue for third-party relevance without risking election spoilers. This project focuses on comparing the longevity, cost, and success of third parties in states where fusion voting is legal versus those where it is not.
