DS5110 Big Data Systems
This website will be used for a course taught at the University of Virginia by Dr. Judy Fox about Big Data Systems. This course covers the current state and future trends in hardware and software for Big Data Systems and applications. Our overarching goal is to build efficient software and hardware for big data processing, analytics and machine learning at scale.
The site is rendered on Github Pages and is composed of student projects for the class.
